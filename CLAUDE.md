# Website Design and Development Best Practices (2026, AI Era)

![Malosteel Logo](MSL-logo-web.png)

## 1. Strategy and Goals
- Define a clear primary goal for each page and design around that main action.
- Use content‑first design: plan information architecture and messaging before visuals.
- Identify core user journeys and minimize steps and friction for those tasks.
- Document audience, constraints (performance, accessibility, security), and success metrics before building.

## 2. UX and Information Architecture
- Keep interfaces simple and focused; reduce cognitive load and clutter.
- Use clear hierarchy: meaningful headings (H1–H3), short paragraphs, scannable sections.
- Keep navigation consistent with descriptive labels and logical grouping.
- Limit top-level navigation items (roughly 5–7) to avoid overwhelming users.
- Provide clear visual feedback for all interactions (hover, focus, loading, errors).
- Use specific calls to action and avoid multiple competing primary CTAs on a single view.

## 3. Visual Design and Layout
- Favor content-driven layouts with strong hierarchy and ample white space.
- Design mobile-first and enhance progressively for larger viewports.
- Use a simple color system (e.g., 60-30-10 for primary, secondary, accent).
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG minimums (at least 4.5:1 for body text).
- Limit typography to 2–3 font families with a clear type scale and consistent line spacing.
- Add modern visual patterns (organic shapes, curves, soft shadows) without harming readability.
- Use animations sparingly; keep them purposeful, short, and performant (CSS transforms, opacity).

## 4. Accessibility
- Follow WCAG POUR principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust.
- Use semantic HTML: headings plus landmarks like main, nav, article, aside, footer.
- Ensure full keyboard accessibility with visible focus states for all interactive elements.
- Provide descriptive alt text for meaningful images and empty alt for decorative ones.
- Do not rely solely on color to convey meaning; pair with text or icons.
- Support cognitive accessibility: clear language, predictable layouts, limited distractions, simple flows.
- Bake accessibility into design systems and components so they are compliant by default.

## 5. Performance and Core Web Vitals
- Treat performance as a core feature, not a late optimization step.
- Target Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1.
- Optimize images (WebP/AVIF, responsive srcset, lazy load non-critical visuals).
- Reduce HTTP requests and third-party scripts; drop unused libraries.
- Defer or async non-critical JavaScript; use code splitting for smaller initial bundles.
- Preload critical assets (fonts, key CSS, hero media) to speed first render.
- Reserve space for dynamic content to prevent layout shifts.
- Use CDNs and edge deployments to reduce latency for global users.

## 6. Mobile-First and Responsive Design
- Start from the smallest viewport and scale the layout upward.
- Make tap targets at least 44×44px and space them to avoid mis-taps.
- Show value proposition and primary CTA above the fold on mobile where possible.
- Use Flexbox and Grid for flexible responsive layouts.
- Test on real devices and real network conditions, not just desktop emulators.

## 7. Content, SEO, and AI-Search Readiness
- Write clear, user-focused content that directly addresses user questions and tasks.
- Use descriptive titles, meta descriptions, and headings aligned with search intent.
- Add structured data (e.g., FAQ, Article, Product schema) where relevant.
- Keep internal linking logical and shallow to aid both users and crawlers.
- Ensure pages are fast and mobile-friendly to support search visibility.
- Use answer-first formatting: start sections with a concise answer, then elaborate.

## 8. Navigation and Findability
- Keep navigation persistent and predictable with clear, plain-language labels.
- Add search functionality on content-heavy sites and tune for relevance and speed.
- Use breadcrumbs to show location in deeper hierarchies.
- Place secondary links (legal, policies, careers, socials) in the footer.

## 9. Security and Privacy
- Treat AI-generated and third-party code as untrusted until reviewed.
- Validate inputs, encode outputs, and use parameterized queries to prevent injection.
- Apply least-privilege access to databases, APIs, and infrastructure.
- Enforce HTTPS everywhere; use secure cookies and strong authentication (MFA where appropriate).
- Keep dependencies up to date and run automated security scans regularly.
- Provide clear privacy notices and consent management for tracking and personalization.

## 10. AI Use in Design and Development
- Use AI to accelerate work (boilerplate, variants, tests, copy drafts), not to replace human judgment.
- Require human review of AI-generated code for security, performance, and architecture before merging.
- Capture and share effective prompts and workflows as team knowledge.
- Use AI to assist testing (test generation, visual regression, cross-browser coverage) while humans define acceptance.
- Apply AI-driven personalization within strict performance, privacy, and UX boundaries.

## 11. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Integrate continuous testing into CI/CD: unit, integration, E2E, accessibility, performance.
- Run automated cross-browser and cross-device tests for critical user journeys.
- Use resilient or self-healing locators in UI tests to reduce maintenance.
- Combine automated accessibility checks with manual review for core templates.
- Monitor production with real-user metrics and logs; feed findings back into development.

## 12. Frameworks, Architecture, and Infrastructure
- Choose frameworks based on problem fit and team skills (e.g., React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt, SvelteKit).
- Prefer meta-frameworks for built-in routing, SSR/SSG, and performance optimizations.
- Use modular, component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- Design for CDN and edge deployment when latency and global reach matter.
- Manage configuration and secrets via secure environment variables or secret managers.

## 13. No-Code/Low-Code and Design Systems
- Use no-code/low-code tools for fast MVPs, marketing pages, and simple workflows.
- Evaluate no-code outputs like regular code for performance, accessibility, and security.
- Maintain a design system (tokens, components, patterns) to enforce consistency and speed.
- Build responsiveness, accessibility, and performance into shared components from the start.

## 14. Analytics and Continuous Improvement
- Track key metrics: Core Web Vitals, conversions, task completion, errors, and support tickets.
- Use A/B or multivariate testing for changes to critical flows and messaging.
- Review analytics and logs regularly to find UX, performance, and accessibility issues.
- Schedule refactoring and UX cleanup cycles to manage technical and design debt.

## 15. Ethics, Sustainability, and Trust
- Avoid dark patterns; favor transparent, user-respecting flows and controls.
- Keep pages lean in size and requests to reduce energy use and support low-bandwidth users.
- Be transparent where AI is used and offer human fallback for important interactions.
- Design branding, language, and interactions to be inclusive and respectful across audiences.
